# Netflix-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview:
In this project I analysed the dataset of Netflix shows & movies (data source â€“ Kaggle) to discover how audience feel about their favourite and least favourite content/shows.
During this project, I deepened my hands-on experience with various text cleaning processes like tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, handling punctuation and special characters. These steps were crucial in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data used for training our NLP models.

~Model Training: Utilized the Bag of Words model for feature extraction.<br>
~Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy and reliable sentiment classification on a diverse dataset.<br>
~Visualization: Display sentiment analysis results with informative charts and graphs.<br> 

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python<br>
Libraries:<br>
NLP: NLTK<br>
Machine Learning: scikit-learn<br>
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy<br>
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn<br>

# Model
The sentiment analysis model is built using the Bag of Words approach for feature extraction, followed by a machine learning classifier to achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification.

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 82.39% and precision of 81.04% on the test dataset, providing reliable sentiment classifications. Visualizations of the sentiment distribution offer insights into viewer preferences and opinions.
